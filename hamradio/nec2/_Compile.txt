Modify Nec2dpar.inc to create new executable types.
Modify G77port.inc to reflect compiler version.

For the windows-95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP compilation the 
DGJPP- and the MinGW port for the GNU G77 (v 3.2)
were used.

Latest insights (feb-2006) learn that the DJGPP port
does not always run on latest Windows-XP systems.

For DJGPP see http://www.delorie.com/djgpp
For MinGW see http://www.mingfw.org

If required, create custom include files or edit the
NEC2DPAR.INC file to create executables with your own
array sizes.

Compile and link command (for both ports):

Copy nec2dXXX.inc nec2dpar.inc
g77 -O -fno-automatic -Wall nec2dxs.f -o nec2dxsXXX.exe

Ignore the warnings produced, they are a result op the
optimization flag -O.
