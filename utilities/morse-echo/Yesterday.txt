Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it look as though they are here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
=
Suddenly I am not half the man I used to be
There is a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly
=
Why she had to go I do not know, she would not say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
=
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
=
Why she had to go I do not know, she would not say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
=
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
