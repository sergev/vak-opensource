# Chapter 1: Introduction to Advanced Programming

This chapter introduces key concepts, styled to resemble a book like *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.

## 1.1 Functional Programming

Functional programming emphasizes immutability and higher-order functions. For example, consider the function composition $f \circ g$, where $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = x + 1$:

$$
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = (x + 1)^2
$$

## 1.2 Code Example

Here’s a Python implementation of function composition:

```python
def compose(f, g):
    """Compose two functions: f(g(x))."""
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

def square(x):
    return x * x

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

# Example usage
result = compose(square, increment)(3)  # (3 + 1)^2 = 16
print(result)
```

## 1.3 Exercise

**Exercise 1.1**: Modify the `compose` function to handle three functions. Test it with $h(x) = \sqrt{x}$, $f(x) = x^2$, and $g(x) = x + 1$.

## 1.4 Data Structures

The following table summarizes common data structures:

| Structure     | Time Complexity (Access) | Example Use Case       |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Array         | O(1)                     | Lookup tables          |
| Linked List   | O(n)                     | Dynamic data           |
| Hash Table    | O(1) average             | Key-value storage      |

As noted by [@doe2020], efficient data structures are critical for performance.[^note1]
