West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front
door.
There is a small mailbox here.

>south

South of House
You are facing the south side of a white house. There is no door here, and all
the windows are boarded.

>east

Behind House
You are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one
corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

>open window

With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

>enter house

Kitchen
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used
recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark
staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east
is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water

>west

Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy
case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

>get lamp

Taken.

>move rug

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the
dusty cover of a closed trap door.

>open trap door

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.

>turn on the lamp

The brass lantern is now on.

>down

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a
crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is
unclimbable.

>south

East of Chasm
You are on the east edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. A
narrow passage goes north, and the path you are on continues to the east.

>east

Gallery
This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings have been stolen by vandals with
exceptional taste. The vandals left through either the north or west exits.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far
wall is a painting of unparalleled beauty.

>get painting

Taken.

>north

Studio
This appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are
splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of
value is hanging here. At the south end of the room is an open door (also
covered with paint). A dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace;
although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back
down.
Loosely attached to a wall is a small piece of paper.

>up

Kitchen
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water

>up

Attic
This is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down.
A large coil of rope is lying in the corner.
On a table is a nasty-looking knife.

>get knife and rope

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.

>down

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

>north

The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole
leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the
walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the
room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
The axe crashes against the rock, throwing sparks!

>kill troll with sword

The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart:  He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black
fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

>drop sword

Dropped.

>east

East-West Passage
This is a narrow east-west passageway. There is a narrow stairway leading down
at the north end of the room.

>east

Round Room
This is a circular stone room with passages in all directions. Several of them
have unfortunately been blocked by cave-ins.

>se

Engravings Cave
You have entered a low cave with passages leading northwest and east.
There are old engravings on the walls here.

>east

Dome Room
You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another
room below. Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which
circles the dome.

>tie rope to railing

The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.

>climb down rope

Torch Room
This is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. Above
you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden
railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.
A piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above
your head.
Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.

>south

Temple
This is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient
inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is
a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north
end of the room is through huge marble pillars.
There is a brass bell here.

>east

Egyptian Room
This is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb. There is an ascending
staircase to the west.
The solid-gold coffin used for the burial of Ramses II is here.

>get coffin

Taken.

>west

Temple
There is a brass bell here.

>south

Altar
This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears to be
an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness.
You probably could not get back up it.
On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.
On the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.

>pray

Forest
This is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there appears to be
sunlight.

>turn off the lamp

The brass lantern is now off.

>south

Forest
This is a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.

>north

Clearing
You are in a small clearing in a well marked forest path that extends to the
east and west.

>east

Canyon View
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there is a
marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream. Across the
canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead
Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls
may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a
great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense forest,
stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb
down into the canyon from here.

>down

Rocky Ledge
You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You can see
from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage which it
is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above you is
more cliff, which appears climbable.

>down

Canyon Bottom
You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable here. The
lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below. To the north is a
narrow path.

>north

End of Rainbow
You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the
Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs. The river
canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the
falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the southwest.

>drop coffin

Dropped.

>open coffin

The gold coffin opens.
A sceptre, possibly that of ancient Egypt itself, is in the coffin. The sceptre
is ornamented with colored enamel, and tapers to a sharp point.

>get sceptre

Taken.

>wave sceptre

Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture, walkable (I think
the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
A shimmering pot of gold appears at the end of the rainbow.

>look

End of Rainbow

Chasm
A chasm runs southwest to northeast and the path follows it. You are on the
south side of the chasm, where a crack opens into a passage.

>ne

Reservoir South
You are in a long room on the south shore of a large lake, far too deep and wide
for crossing.
There is a path along the stream to the east or west, a steep pathway climbing
southwest along the edge of a chasm, and a path leading into a canyon to the
southeast.

>east

Dam
You are standing on the top of the Flood Control Dam #3, which was quite a
tourist attraction in times far distant. There are paths to the north, south,
and west, and a scramble down.
The sluice gates on the dam are closed. Behind the dam, there can be seen a wide
reservoir. Water is pouring over the top of the now abandoned dam.
There is a control panel here, on which a large metal bolt is mounted. Directly
above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.

>north

Dam Lobby
This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring the dam.
There are open doorways here to the north and east marked "Private", and there
is a path leading south over the top of the dam.
Some guidebooks entitled "Flood Control Dam #3" are on the reception desk.
There is a matchbook whose cover says "Visit Beautiful FCD#3" here.

>get matches

Taken.

>north

Maintenance Room
This is what appears to have been the maintenance room for Flood Control Dam #3.
Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of the valuable
equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a group of buttons colored
blue, yellow, brown, and red. There are doorways to the west and south.
There is a group of tool chests here.
There is a wrench here.
There is an object which looks like a tube of toothpaste here.

Deep Canyon
You are on the south edge of a deep canyon. Passages lead off to the east,
northwest and southwest. A stairway leads down. You can hear a loud roaring
sound, like that of rushing water, from below.

>down

Loud Room
This is a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from the ground.
There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone stairway leading upward.
The room is deafeningly loud with an undetermined rushing sound. The sound seems
to reverberate from all of the walls, making it difficult even to think.
On the ground is a large platinum bar.
It is unbearably loud here, with an ear-splitting roar seeming to come from all
around you. There is a pounding in your head which won't stop. With a tremendous
effort, you scramble out of the room.

Cave
This is a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark, forbidding
staircase leading down.
A gust of wind blows out your candles!

>down

Entrance to Hades
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed

  Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled
bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be
heard.
The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to
pass.

>ring the bell

The bell suddenly becomes red hot and falls to the ground. The wraiths, as if
paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to face you. On their ashen faces,
the expression of a long-forgotten terror takes shape.
In your confusion, the candles drop to the ground (and they are out).

>take candles

Taken.

>light match

One of the matches starts to burn.

>light the candles with the match

The candles are lit.
The flames flicker wildly and appear to dance. The earth beneath your feet
trembles, and your legs nearly buckle beneath you. The spirits cower at your
unearthly power.
The match has gone out.

>read the book

Each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening confusion.
As the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding, speaks: "Begone, fiends!"
A heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, and the spirits, sensing a greater
power, flee through the walls.

>drop book

Dropped.

>south

Land of the Dead
You have entered the Land of the Living Dead. Thousands of lost souls can be
heard weeping and moaning. In the corner are stacked the remains of dozens of
previous adventurers less fortunate than yourself. A passage exits to the north.
Lying in one corner of the room is a beautifully carved crystal skull. It
appears to be grinning at you rather nastily.

the east is a long passage, and there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.
To the north is a small opening.

>north

Mine Entrance
You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal mine. The shaft
enters the west wall, and there is another exit on the south end of the room.

Forest Path
This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south

the path.

>climb up tree

Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The
nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently
scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and
ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is
hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely
fragile.

Cyclops Room
This room has an exit on the northwest, and a staircase leading up.
A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere adventurers), blocks
the staircase. From his state of health, and the bloodstains on the walls, you
gather that he is not very friendly, though he likes people.

>ulysses

The cyclops, hearing the name of his father's deadly nemesis, flees the room by
knocking down the wall on the east of the room.

>up

You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway. Using
passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room suddenly vanish.

Treasure Room
This is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of discarded
bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the floor. There is an
exit down a staircase.
There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning against
one wall. He is armed with a deadly stiletto.
There is a silver chalice, intricately engraved, here.
The thief rams the haft of his blade into your stomach, leaving you out of
breath.

The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity, but accepts the jewel-
encrusted egg and stops to admire its beauty.

Strange Passage
This is a long passage. To the west is one entrance. On the east there is an old
wooden door, with a large opening in it (about cyclops sized).
A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through the room. On
the way through, he quietly abstracted some valuables from the room and from
your possession, mumbling something about "Doing unto others before..."

Your stroke lands, but it was only the flat of the blade.
The thief rams the haft of his blade into your stomach, leaving you out of
breath.

You are still recovering from that last blow, so your attack is ineffective.
You dodge as the thief comes in low.

The thief slowly approaches, strikes like a snake, and leaves you wounded.

A good slash, but it misses the thief by a mile.
A long, theatrical slash. You catch it on your nasty knife, but the thief twists
his knife, and the nasty knife goes flying.

>kill thief with knife

The unarmed thief cannot defend himself: He dies.
Almost as soon as the thief breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black
fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his treasures reappear:
  A leather bag of coins
  A crystal skull
  A stiletto
  A jewel-encrusted egg, with a golden clockwork canary
The chalice is now safe to take.

The canary chirps, slightly off-key, an aria from a forgotten opera. From out of
the greenery flies a lovely songbird. It perches on a limb just over your head
and opens its beak to sing. As it does so a beautiful brass bauble drops from
its mouth, bounces off the top of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.
As the canary winds down, the songbird flies away.

Stone Barrow
You are standing in front of a massive barrow of stone. In the east face is a
huge stone door which is open. You cannot see into the dark of the tomb.

Inside the Barrow
As you enter the barrow, the door closes inexorably behind you. Around you it is
dark, but ahead is an enormous cavern, brightly lit. Through its center runs a
wide stream. Spanning the stream is a small wooden footbridge, and beyond a path
leads into a dark tunnel. Above the bridge, floating in the air, is a large
sign. It reads:  All ye who stand before this bridge have completed a great and
perilous adventure which has tested your wit and courage. You have mastered the
first part of the ZORK trilogy. Those who pass over this bridge must be prepared
to undertake an even greater adventure that will severely test your skill and
bravery!

The ZORK trilogy continues with "ZORK II: The Wizard of Frobozz" and is
completed in "ZORK III: The Dungeon Master."
Your score is 350 (total of 350 points), in 330 moves.
This gives you the rank of Master Adventurer.
