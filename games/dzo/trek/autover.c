/*
**  Automatic Override
**
**      If we should be so unlucky as to be caught in a quadrant
**      with a supernova in it, this routine is called.  It is
**      called from checkcond().
**
**      It sets you to a random warp (guaranteed to be over 6.0)
**      and starts sending you off "somewhere" (whereever that is).
**
**      Please note that it is VERY important that you reset your
**      warp speed after the automatic override is called.  The new
**      warp factor does not stay in effect for just this routine.
**
**      This routine will never try to send you more than sqrt(2)
**      quadrants, since that is all that is needed.
