 ABSTRACT


      INTCODE is a very simple machine code with an
      equally simple assembly language.  An assembler
      and interpreter for it is easy to write and may
      be used for the initial step of bootstrapping
      BCPL onto a new machine.

       INTCODE - An Interpretive Machine Code for BCPL
       -----------------------------------------------


 INTCODE is an interpretive machine code which was designed to
 ease the initial bootstrapping of BCPL [1, 2, 3] onto a new machine.
 The main advantage of INTCODE is that it is compact and its assembler
 and interpreter are both easy to implement.  The assembler and
 interpreter are together about 4 to 6 times smaller than a typical
 BCPL codegenerator from OCODE to assembly language and can be
 implemented in machine code in about 2 days.  The INTCODE form of
 the entire BCPL compiler from BCPL to INTCODE takes about 1000 lines
 of 72 characters composed as follows:

      Syntax analyser     BCPL to AE TREE     400 lines
      Translation phase   AE TREE to OCODE    400 lines
      Code Generator      OCODE to INTCODE    200 lines

 Even though with INTCODE one loses a factor of about 10 to one in
 execution speed, it is still a useful tool for the initial
 implementation of BCPL on a new machine since it allows the first
 production codegenerator to be written directly in BCPL.

 The INTCODE Machine
 -------------------

 The INTCODE machine has a store consisting of equal sized
 locations addressed by consecutive integers.  The word size is
 implementation dependent but should normally be at least 24 bits
 in order to hold all the fields of an instruction.  On a 16 bit
 machine, one can use 16 bit and 32 bit instructions; the choice
 between short and long instructions being made by the INTCODE
 assembler.

 The central registers of the machine are as follows:

 A,B:     The Accumulator and Auxiliary Accumulator.

 C:       The Control Register giving the location of
          next instruction to be executed.

 D:       The Address register used to hold the effective address
          of an instruction.

 P:       A pointer used to address the local work area and
          function arguments.

 G:       A pointer used to address the global vector.


 The format of an instruction is composed of five fields
 as follows:


 Function Part:      This is a three bit field specifying one of the
                     eight possible machine functions described below.

 Address field:      This is a field specifying a positive integer which
                     is the initial value of D.  The address field should
                     contain at least 14 or 15 bits.

 P bit:              A single bit to specify whether P is to be added
                     into D at the second stage of address evaluation.

 G bit:              A single bit to specify whether G is to be added
                     into D at the third stage of address evaluation.

 I bit:              This is the indirection bit.  If it is a one then D
                     is replaced by the contents of the location addressed
                     by D at the last stage of address evaluation.


 The effective address is evaluated in the same way for every
 instruction independent of the particular machine function specified.


 The eight machine functions are as follows:


 0)     Load                                           Mnemonic L

        Load the effective address into the accumulator A saving
        its previous value in B.

        B := A;     A := D

 1)     Store                                          Mnemonic S

        Store the accumulator A into the location addressed by D.

        Location (D) := A

 2)     Add                                            Mnemonic A

        Add the effective address D into the accumulator A.

        A := A + D

 3)     Jump                                           Mnemonic J

        Cause a transfer of control by setting the control register C
        to the effective address D.

        C := D

 4)     Jump if True                                   Mnemonic T

        This is a conditional transfer which sets the control register C
        to D if the Accumulator A is non-zero.

        IF A~= O DO C := D

 5)     Jump if False                                  Mnemonic F

        This is a conditional transfer which sets the control register C
        to D if the accumulator A is zero.

        IF A=0 DO C := D

 6)     Call a function                                Mnemonic K

        Cause a recursive function call to take place.  The current
        stack frame size is specified by D and the function entry point
        is given in A.  The first two cells of the new stack frame are set
        to hold the return link information.

        D := P + D

        Location(D), Location(D+1) := P, C

        P,C := D,A

 7)     Execute operation                              Mnemonic X

        This instruction allows auxiliary operations to be executed.
        The operation is specified by the value of D which should be a
        small integer.  These operations are mainly of an arithmetic or
        logical nature working on the accumulators A and B, and are
        specified as follows:

      X1: A := Location (A)

      X2: A := -A

      X3: A := NOT A

      X4: This causes a return from the current function or routine;
          by convention the result fo a function is left in A.

          C := Location(P + 1)

          P := Location(P)

      X5: A := B * A

      X6: A := B / A

      X7: A := B REM A

      X8: A := B + A

      X9: A := B - A

      X10: A := B = A

      X11: A := B ~= A

      X12: A := B < A

      X13: A := B >= A

      X14: A := B > A

      X15: A := B <= A

      X16: A := B LSHIFT A     // vacated positions

      X17: A := B RSHIFT A     // are filled with zeroes

      X18: A := B LOGAND A

      X19: A := B LOGOR A

      X20: A := B NEQV A

      X21: A := B EQV A

      X22: FINISH
      X23: Switch on the value of A using data in the location
           addressed by C, C+1 etc.

           B, D := Location(C), Location(C + 1)

           UNTIL B = 0 DO

                $( B, C := B - 1, C + 2

                     IF A=Location(C) DO

                          $( D := Location(C + 1)

                               BREAK $)       $)

           C := D

      X24:These are implementation dependent instructions
      X25: for input/output operations and other special
           functions.  See the listing  of the INTCODE interpreter
           in the appendix.


 INTCODE Assembly Language
 _________________________

 The assembly language for INTCODE has been designed to be
 compact and simple to assemble, but care has also been taken so
 that it can be read and modified with reasonable ease by a
 programmer.  The text of the assembly language is composed of
 letters, digits, spaces, newlines and the characters '/' and
 dollar '$'.

 Slash is used as a continuation symbol;  it is skipped and
 the remaining characters of the line up to and including the
 next newline character are ignored.  Its main purpose is to
 simplify the efficient use of cards as a medium for transferring
 INTCODE programs.

 Dollar marks the entry point of a function or routine and is
 otherwise ignorable.  Its sole purpose is to help the implementer
 find his way around compiled code.

 The assembly form of an instruction consists of the mnemonic
 letter for the machine function, optionally followed by 'I' if
 indirection is specified, optionally followed by 'P' or 'G' if
 P or G modifications are specified, followed by the address which
 is either a decimal integer or an assembly parameter which appears
 as 'L' followed by a decimal integer.  Assembly parameters are
 numbered in the range 1 to 500 and are used to label points in the
 program.  A number not preceded by a letter is interpreted as a
 label and causes the specified assembly parameter to be set to the
 address of the next location to be loaded.

 The mnemonics for the machine functions are L, S, A, J, T, F, K
 and X as described in the previous section.

 Data may be assembled by a statement consisting of 'D' followed
 by a signed decimal integer for constant values or 'DL' followed by
 an assembly parameter number for pointers.  Characters may be packed
 and assembled using character statements of the form 'C' followed by
 the integer code for the character.  The character size and number
 of characters per word are machine dependent and it is left to the
 assembler to pack character strings appropriately.  A label,
 instruction or data statement will cause the latest character string
 to be padded with zeros so that the loading pointer points to the
 start of a full word.

 It is possible to initialise global variables during assembly,
 using a directive of the form 'G' followed by a global number,
 followed by 'L' and an assembly parameter number.  Thus G36L73 will
 cause global 36 of the INTCODE machine to be set to the value of
 assembly parameter number 73.

 'Z' is used to mark the end of each segment of code.  Its effect
 is to unset all the numerical parameters.


 Conclusion
 ----------

 The effectiveness of INTCODE lies mainly in its simplicity making
 it easy to understand and implement; however, it is also compact and
 even with a simple non-optimising code generator the compiled code is
 smaller than straightforward machine code for most machines by a factor
 of nearly two to one.

 Example
 -------

 The following BCPL program:


 GLOBAL $( START:1; WRITEF:76 $)

 LET START () BE $(1

 LET F(N) = N=0 -> 1, N*F(N-1)

 FOR I = 1 TO 10 DO WRITEF("F(%N), = %N*N", I, F(I))

 FINISH $)1

 compiles into the following INTCODE:

 $ 1 JL4
 $ 2 LO LIP2 X10 FL6 L1 SP3 JL5 6 LIP2 L1 X9 SP5 LIL3 K3 LIP2 X5 SP3 5 L/
 IP3 X4 4 L1 SP2 J17 8 LI499 SP5 LIP2 SP6 LIP2 SP9 LIL3 K7 SP7 LIG76 K3 /
