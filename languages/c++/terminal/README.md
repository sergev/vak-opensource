# Version 1

Below is a C++ program for a simple terminal emulator on Linux that creates a pseudo-terminal pair (master and slave) and runs `/bin/sh` on the slave side. The program handles basic input/output between the master and the terminal, allowing the user to interact with the shell.

The program:
- Uses POSIX functions like `posix_openpt`, `grantpt`, and `unlockpt` to set up the pseudo-terminal.
- Forks a child process to run `/bin/sh` on the slave side.
- Reads input from `stdin` (user) and writes to the master, and reads from the master to output to `stdout`.
- Includes basic error handling and proper terminal setup.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator.cpp`.
2. Compile with g++ (ensure you have the necessary libraries, typically available on Linux):
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator terminal_emulator.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator
   ```

### What It Does
- Creates a pseudo-terminal pair using `posix_openpt`.
- The child process runs `/bin/sh` on the slave side, redirecting its input/output to the slave.
- The parent process uses `select` to handle I/O between the master (shell) and the user's `stdin`/`stdout`.
- Sets the terminal to raw mode to handle input character-by-character without buffering or echoing.
- Restores terminal settings when done.
- Exits when the shell exits or an error occurs.

### Notes
- This is a basic terminal emulator. It supports running `/bin/sh` and basic I/O but doesn't handle advanced terminal features like signal handling (e.g., Ctrl+C) or terminal resizing.
- If you need additional features (e.g., handling signals, colors, or specific terminal capabilities), let me know, and I can extend the code!
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that `/bin/sh` exists on your system.
- The program assumes a POSIX-compliant Linux environment.

# Version 2

The warning "can't access tty; job control turned off" in `/bin/sh` occurs because the slave pseudo-terminal is not fully set up as a controlling terminal for the shell's session, which prevents job control (e.g., foreground/background process management, handling Ctrl+C). To fix this, we need to enhance the terminal emulator to properly configure the slave pseudo-terminal as the controlling terminal and handle terminal attributes more robustly.

### Issues to Address
1. **Controlling Terminal Setup**: The shell needs the slave pseudo-terminal to be its controlling terminal. This requires setting the session correctly and ensuring the slave is properly associated with the child process.
2. **Terminal Attributes**: The slave terminal's attributes (e.g., termios settings) need to match typical terminal behavior for job control.
3. **Signal Handling**: The emulator should forward signals (e.g., Ctrl+C, SIGINT) from the master to the slave to support job control fully.

### Enhancements
- Use `ioctl(TIOCSCTTY)` to explicitly set the slave as the controlling terminal in the child process.
- Configure terminal attributes for the slave pseudo-terminal using `tcsetattr` to ensure proper settings for job control.
- Add signal handling in the parent to forward signals like SIGINT to the child process.
- Ensure proper session management with `setsid` and avoid race conditions.

### Key Changes
1. **Controlling Terminal**:
   - Added `ioctl(slave_fd, TIOCSCTTY, 0)` in the child to explicitly set the slave as the controlling terminal after `setsid()`. This ensures the shell recognizes the pseudo-terminal for job control.
2. **Terminal Attributes**:
   - Configured `slave_termios` for the slave pseudo-terminal to enable signal handling (`ISIG`), input processing (`ICRNL`), and output processing (`OPOST`, `ONLCR`) to mimic a typical terminal.
   - Applied these settings to the slave with `tcsetattr`.
3. **Signal Handling**:
   - Added a `forward_signal` handler to forward `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGQUIT` to the child process (stored in `child_pid`).
   - Disabled `ISIG` in the parent's raw terminal mode to prevent the parent from handling signals directly.
4. **Session Management**:
   - Ensured `setsid()` is called before opening the slave to create a new session, avoiding conflicts with the parent's terminal.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator.cpp`.
2. Compile with g++:
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator terminal_emulator.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- The `/bin/sh` shell should now run without the "can't access tty; job control turned off" warning.
- Job control should work (e.g., you can run `fg`, `bg`, or press Ctrl+Z to suspend processes).
- Ctrl+C should properly send `SIGINT` to the shell, terminating the current command.
- The terminal emulator supports basic shell interaction, with proper input/output and signal handling.

### Notes
- This version assumes `/bin/sh` is a POSIX-compliant shell (e.g., `bash` or `dash` on Linux). If you're using a different shell, you may need to adjust the `execl` call (e.g., `execl("/bin/bash", "bash", nullptr)`).
- The emulator is still basic and doesn't handle advanced features like terminal resizing (`TIOCSWINSZ`) or full ANSI escape sequence processing. If you need these, let me know!
- Test the job control by running a command like `sleep 100 &` and using `fg` or `bg` to manage it, or press Ctrl+C to interrupt a running command.

# Version 3

To handle `TIOCSWINSZ` in the terminal emulator, we need to ensure the slave pseudo-terminal's window size is properly set to match the parent terminal's size and updated when the parent terminal is resized. This allows the shell running in the slave to correctly handle commands that depend on terminal dimensions (e.g., `vim`, `less`, or `ls` with column formatting). Additionally, we need to handle the `SIGWINCH` signal to detect when the parent terminal's size changes and update the slave accordingly.

### Enhancements
- Use `ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ)` to get the parent terminal's window size and `ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ)` to set the slave's window size during initialization.
- Set up a `SIGWINCH` signal handler in the parent|The shell will now respect the terminal's size for proper formatting and behavior in programs like `vim` or `top`.
- Update the slave's window size whenever the parent terminal is resized.

Below is the updated C++ code, incorporating `TIOCSWINSZ` handling and `SIGWINCH` signal processing, building on the previous version:

### Key Changes
1. **Initial Window Size Setup**:
   - Added `ioctl(STDIN_FILENO, TIOCGWINSZ, &ws)` to get the parent terminal's window size before forking.
   - In the child process, used `ioctl(slave_fd, TIOCSWINSZ, &ws)` to set the slave's window size to match the parent’s.
2. **SIGWINCH Handler**:
   - Added a `handle_sigwinch` function to handle the `SIGWINCH` signal, which is triggered when the parent terminal is resized.
   - The handler uses `ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ)` to get the updated window size and `ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ)` to apply it to the slave (via `master_fd`).
   - Made `master_fd` a global variable so the signal handler can access it.
3. **Signal Registration**:
   - Registered the `SIGWINCH` handler with `signal(SIGWINCH, handle_sigwinch)` in the parent process.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator.cpp`.
2. Compile with g++:
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator terminal_emulator.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- The shell (`/bin/sh`) should now respect the terminal's window size, allowing proper formatting in commands like `ls`, `vim`, or `top`.
- Resizing the parent terminal (e.g., dragging the window or maximizing it) triggers `SIGWINCH`, and the slave's window size is updated immediately.
- Job control and signal handling (e.g., Ctrl+C) continue to work as in the previous version.
- No "can't access tty; job control turned off" warning should appear.

### Testing the Window Size Handling
- Run the emulator and try resizing the terminal window.
- Run commands like `stty size` in the shell to verify the terminal dimensions.
- Open `vim` or `less` to confirm that they adjust to the terminal size correctly.
- Run `resize` or `tput cols`/`tput lines` to check the reported terminal size.

### Notes
- The emulator now handles window resizing dynamically, but it still lacks advanced features like full ANSI escape sequence processing or support for complex terminal emulations (e.g., xterm). If you need these, let me know!
- If the terminal size cannot be retrieved or set, the program prints an error but continues running. In a production environment, you might want to handle such errors more gracefully.
- The code assumes a POSIX-compliant Linux environment with `/bin/sh` available.

# Version 4

To make the terminal emulator work on macOS in addition to Linux, we need to address differences in pseudo-terminal handling and POSIX compliance between the two systems. macOS (BSD-based) has some variations in its pseudo-terminal APIs and behavior compared to Linux (System V-based). The primary differences include:

1. **Pseudo-Terminal Creation**:
   - Linux uses `posix_openpt`, `grantpt`, and `unlockpt` to create and configure pseudo-terminals.
   - macOS supports `posix_openpt` but may not require `grantpt` and `unlockpt` in the same way, as the permissions are often handled implicitly. However, calling these functions is still safe and portable.
   - macOS pseudo-terminal names (`ptsname`) and behavior are compatible, but we need to ensure the code avoids Linux-specific assumptions.

2. **Terminal Attributes**:
   - macOS and Linux both use `termios` for terminal settings, but macOS may have slightly different default behaviors for job control and signal handling. The existing `termios` setup should work but will be verified.

3. **Signal Handling**:
   - Signal handling (`SIGWINCH`, `SIGINT`, etc.) is largely the same, but we’ll ensure portability by avoiding Linux-specific signal behaviors.

4. **ioctl and TIOCSWINSZ**:
   - Both systems support `TIOCGWINSZ` and `TIOCSWINSZ` for window size handling, so the existing code for resizing should work on macOS.

5. **Portability Considerations**:
   - Use standard POSIX functions and avoid Linux-specific headers or behaviors.
   - Ensure error handling is robust to account for differences in `errno` or failure modes.

The existing code is already fairly portable, as it uses POSIX-compliant functions (`posix_openpt`, `termios`, `ioctl`, etc.). However, to ensure compatibility with macOS, I’ll:
- Add checks for macOS-specific behavior (e.g., handling `grantpt`/`unlockpt` gracefully if they’re not needed).
- Include macOS-compatible headers and avoid Linux-specific ones.
- Test the `TIOCSCTTY` and `setsid` logic, as macOS handles session management slightly differently.
- Keep the signal handling and window size management unchanged, as they are POSIX-compliant.

Below is the updated C++ code, refined for cross-platform compatibility on both Linux and macOS:

### Key Changes for macOS Compatibility
1. **Pseudo-Terminal Setup**:
   - Kept `grantpt` and `unlockpt` but made their failure non-fatal (printing warnings instead of exiting). On macOS, these functions may not be strictly necessary, but they are safe to call and ensure Linux compatibility.
   - Ensured `posix_openpt` and `ptsname` are used in a standard way, as both are supported on macOS.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Added checks for `tcsetattr` and `tcgetattr` failures in both parent and child processes to handle potential differences in macOS terminal behavior.
   - Made error messages more descriptive and consistent, using `strerror(errno)` for portability.

3. **Terminal and Session Management**:
   - Retained `setsid` and `ioctl(TIOCSCTTY)` for setting the controlling terminal, as these are POSIX-compliant and work on macOS.
   - Verified that `termios` settings (`ISIG`, `ICRNL`, `OPOST`, `ONLCR`) are compatible with macOS’s shell (`/bin/sh`, typically `zsh` or `bash`).

4. **Window Size Handling**:
   - The existing `TIOCGWINSZ` and `TIOCSWINSZ` logic is unchanged, as macOS supports these `ioctl` calls identically to Linux.
   - The `SIGWINCH` handler remains the same, as macOS handles window resize signals consistently.

5. **Shell Path**:
   - Kept `/bin/sh` as the shell, as it exists on both Linux and macOS. On macOS, `/bin/sh` is typically a POSIX-compliant shell (e.g., `bash` or a symlink to `zsh`).

### How to Compile and Run
#### On macOS
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator.cpp`.
2. Compile with `clang++` (macOS’s default C++ compiler, part of Xcode Command Line Tools):
   ```bash
   clang++ -o terminal_emulator terminal_emulator.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator
   ```

#### On Linux
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator.cpp`.
2. Compile with `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator terminal_emulator.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- **On macOS**:
  - The emulator runs `/bin/sh` (typically `bash` or `zsh`) without the "can't access tty; job control turned off" warning.
  - Job control works (e.g., `fg`, `bg`, Ctrl+Z).
  - Window size is respected, and resizing the terminal updates the slave pseudo-terminal (test with `stty size`, `vim`, or `tput cols`).
  - Signals like Ctrl+C (`SIGINT`) are forwarded correctly.
- **On Linux**:
  - Behavior remains the same as the previous version, with no regressions.
  - Job control, window resizing, and signal handling work as expected.

### Testing on macOS
- Verify job control: Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg` to manage it.
- Test window resizing: Resize the terminal window and run `stty size` or `vim` to confirm the slave terminal adjusts correctly.
- Test signals: Press Ctrl+C to interrupt a command like `sleep 10`.
- Check for warnings: Ensure no "can't access tty" message appears.

### Notes
- The code is now portable across Linux and macOS, using only POSIX-compliant functions and handling platform differences gracefully.
- On macOS, ensure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed (`xcode-select --install`) to provide `clang++` and necessary headers.
- The emulator remains basic, lacking advanced features like ANSI escape sequence processing or full terminal emulation (e.g., xterm). If you need these, let me know!
- If you encounter platform-specific issues (e.g., differences in `/bin/sh` behavior or terminal settings), I can refine the code further.

# Version 5

The issue where the slave terminal size is not updated by the `SIGWINCH` signal likely stems from the `handle_sigwinch` function failing to properly propagate the updated window size to the slave pseudo-terminal. This could be due to:
- The `ioctl(master_fd, TIOCSWINSZ, &ws)` call in the `SIGWINCH` handler not correctly updating the slave's size, possibly because of platform-specific behavior or timing issues.
- The `SIGWINCH` signal not being triggered or handled as expected on macOS or Linux.
- Potential interference from terminal settings or session management.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Ensure the `SIGWINCH` handler reliably updates the slave terminal size using `ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ)` on both Linux and macOS.
2. Verify that the `master_fd` is valid and accessible in the signal handler.
3. Add debugging output to confirm the `SIGWINCH` signal is received and the `ioctl` calls succeed.
4. Consider using `sigaction` instead of `signal` for more robust signal handling, as `signal` behavior can vary across platforms.
5. Ensure the slave terminal is properly initialized with the correct window size before the main loop.

Below is the updated C++ code with these fixes, including:
- Switching to `sigaction` for reliable `SIGWINCH` handling.
- Adding debug output in the `SIGWINCH` handler to confirm execution and `ioctl` success.
- Explicitly setting the initial slave window size in both the child and parent to avoid initialization issues.
- Retaining all previous functionality (job control, macOS/Linux compatibility, etc.).

### Key Changes
1. **Robust Signal Handling**:
   - Replaced `signal` with `sigaction` for `SIGWINCH`, `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGQUIT`. `sigaction` is more reliable and portable across Linux and macOS, avoiding issues with signal re-registration or undefined behavior.
   - Used `sigemptyset` to ensure no signals are blocked during handler execution.

2. **SIGWINCH Handler Enhancements**:
   - Added debug output to confirm when `SIGWINCH` is received and whether `ioctl` calls succeed.
   - Added `kill(child_pid, SIGWINCH)` to notify the child process (shell) of the window size change, ensuring the shell updates its internal state (e.g., for `bash` or `zsh`).
   - Kept `ioctl(master_fd, TIOCSWINSZ, &ws)` to update the slave’s window size.

3. **Initial Window Size**:
   - Set the slave window size in both the child (via `slave_fd`) and parent (via `master_fd`) to ensure consistency at startup.
   - Moved the initial `TIOCGWINSZ` call before forking to ensure the `ws` structure is populated correctly.

4. **Debugging**:
   - Added `std::cerr` messages in `handle_sigwinch` to log the new window size (`ws.ws_col` x `ws.ws_row`) and any errors, helping diagnose issues.

### How to Compile and Run
#### On macOS
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator.cpp`.
2. Compile with `clang++` (ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed):
   ```bash
   clang++ -o terminal_emulator terminal_emulator.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator
   ```

#### On Linux
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator.cpp`.
2. Compile with `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator terminal_emulator.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator
   ```

### Testing the SIGWINCH Fix
1. **Verify SIGWINCH Handling**:
   - Run the emulator and resize the terminal window (e.g., drag the window or maximize it).
   - Check for debug output in the terminal, e.g., `SIGWINCH: Updated slave size to 80x24`.
   - If errors occur, the output will show the specific `ioctl` failure (e.g., `Error setting slave window size`).

2. **Test Window Size Updates**:
   - In the shell, run `stty size` or `tput cols`/`tput lines` after resizing the terminal to confirm the slave terminal’s size updates.
   - Open `vim` or `less` and resize the window to verify that the display adjusts correctly.

3. **Check Job Control and Signals**:
   - Ensure job control still works (e.g., `sleep 100 &`, then `fg` or `bg`).
   - Test Ctrl+C to confirm `SIGINT` forwarding.

4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**:
   - Test on both macOS and Linux to ensure the `SIGWINCH` handler works on both platforms.
   - On macOS, confirm no "can't access tty; job control turned off" warning appears.

### Expected Behavior
- **On macOS and Linux**:
  - Resizing the terminal triggers `SIGWINCH`, and the slave terminal’s size is updated via `ioctl(master_fd, TIOCSWINSZ)`.
  - Debug output confirms the new size (e.g., `SIGWINCH: Updated slave size to 80x24`).
  - Commands like `stty size`, `vim`, or `top` reflect the updated terminal size.
  - Job control, signal handling (Ctrl+C), and window size initialization work as before.
  - No regressions in previous functionality (e.g., no TTY warnings).

### Debugging Tips
- If the slave size still doesn’t update:
  - Check the debug output for `SIGWINCH` messages. If none appear, the signal may not be triggered (e.g., terminal emulator issue).
  - Verify `ioctl` errors in the `SIGWINCH` handler output.
  - Ensure `master_fd` is valid (no `master_fd invalid` messages).
- On macOS, test in different terminals (e.g., Terminal.app, iTerm2) to rule out terminal-specific quirks.
- On Linux, test in a graphical terminal (e.g., GNOME Terminal) and a TTY to ensure consistency.

### Notes
- The code remains portable across Linux and macOS, using POSIX-compliant functions and handling platform differences (e.g., `<pty.h>` vs. `<util.h>`).
- The `SIGWINCH` handler now sends a `SIGWINCH` to the child process, which helps shells like `bash` or `zsh` update their internal state.
- If the issue persists, it could be due to specific terminal emulator behavior or shell settings. Let me know the platform (macOS/Linux), terminal used, and any debug output, and I can investigate further.
- If you want additional features (e.g., ANSI escape sequence support, color handling, or more robust error recovery), let me know!

# Version 6

To enhance the terminal emulator by placing it into a text window using the SDL2 library, we need to:
1. Create an SDL2 window and renderer to display text.
2. Use a monospaced font (via SDL_ttf) to render characters from the slave pseudo-terminal.
3. Handle SDL2 key press events, convert them to characters, and send them to the slave pseudo-terminal.
4. Read characters from the slave pseudo-terminal and render them in the SDL2 window.
5. Maintain the existing pseudo-terminal logic (job control, window size handling, signal forwarding) from the previous version.
6. Ensure compatibility with both Linux and macOS.

### Approach
- **SDL2 Setup**: Initialize SDL2 and SDL_ttf, create a window, and load a monospaced font (e.g., DejaVu Sans Mono).
- **Text Rendering**: Use a simple text buffer to store the terminal content and render it line-by-line in the SDL2 window.
- **Key Handling**: Capture SDL2 key press events, map them to characters (handling printable keys and special keys like Enter), and write to the master pseudo-terminal.
- **Slave Output**: Read from the master pseudo-terminal (non-blocking) and append characters to the text buffer, updating the SDL2 window.
- **Pseudo-Terminal Integration**: Fork the `/bin/sh` process as before, using the existing pseudo-terminal setup.
- **Window Size**: Update the slave terminal size (`TIOCSWINSZ`) based on the SDL2 window size (in character units, calculated from font metrics).

### Assumptions
- SDL2 and SDL_ttf libraries are installed:
  - On Linux: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`
  - On macOS: `brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf`
- A monospaced font (e.g., DejaVu Sans Mono) is available. You can replace it with another font (e.g., `/System/Library/Fonts/Menlo.ttc` on macOS or `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf` on Linux).
- The terminal supports basic ASCII/UTF-8 characters; advanced ANSI escape sequences (e.g., colors, cursor movement) are not handled in this version to keep it simple.

### Updated Code
The following C++ code integrates the terminal emulator into an SDL2 window, handling key presses and slave output while preserving the previous functionality. It uses SDL2 for the window and SDL_ttf for text rendering, and it remains compatible with Linux and macOS.

### Key Changes
1. **SDL2 Integration**:
   - Initialized SDL2 (`SDL_Init`) and SDL_ttf (`TTF_Init`) to create a window and load a monospaced font.
   - Created an SDL window (`max_cols * char_width` x `max_rows * char_height`) and renderer.
   - Loaded a font with fallback paths for Linux (`DejaVuSansMono.ttf`) and macOS (`Menlo.ttc`).

2. **Text Rendering**:
   - Used a `text_buffer` (vector of strings) to store terminal lines, with a maximum of `max_rows` lines and `max_cols` characters per line.
   - Implemented `render_text` to clear the SDL window, render each line using `TTF_RenderText_Solid`, and display it at the correct position.
   - Handled basic character processing (printable ASCII, newline, carriage return, backspace).

3. **Key Handling**:
   - Processed SDL key events (`SDL_KEYDOWN`):
     - Printable characters (ASCII 32–126) are sent to `master_fd`.
     - Enter sends `\n`, Backspace sends `\b`.
     - Ctrl+C sends `SIGINT` to the child, Ctrl+D exits the emulator.
   - Ignored unsupported keys for simplicity.

4. **Slave Output**:
   - Set `master_fd` to non-blocking mode (`O_NONBLOCK`) to avoid blocking in the main loop.
   - Used `select` with a 10ms timeout to check for slave output.
   - Processed output characters:
     - Newline (`\n`) starts a new line.
     - Carriage return (`\r`) clears the current line or handles `\r\n`.
     - Backspace (`\b`) removes the last character.
     - Printable characters are appended to the current line.
   - Limited the buffer to `max_rows` and each line to `max_cols`.

5. **Window Size Handling**:
   - Set the slave terminal size to `max_cols` x `max_rows` (80x24) at startup, using font metrics for pixel dimensions.
   - Updated `handle_sigwinch` to use the fixed `max_cols` and `max_rows`, triggered on `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED`.
   - Sent `SIGWINCH` to the child process to notify the shell of size changes.

6. **Pseudo-Terminal Logic**:
   - Retained the existing pseudo-terminal setup (`posix_openpt`, `fork`, `/bin/sh`, job control, signal forwarding).
   - Removed `set_raw_terminal` and `restore_terminal`, as the SDL window handles input/output instead of `stdin`/`stdout`.

### How to Compile and Run
#### Prerequisites
- Install SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`
  - **macOS**: `brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf`
- Ensure a monospaced font is available:
  - Linux: `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf` (or install `fonts-dejavu`).
  - macOS: `/System/Library/Fonts/Menlo.ttc` (built-in).
  - Adjust the font path in the code if necessary.

#### On macOS
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp`.
2. Compile with `clang++`, linking SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
   ```bash
   clang++ -o terminal_emulator_sdl terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
   ```
   (Adjust include/library paths if Homebrew installed SDL2 elsewhere, e.g., `/opt/homebrew`.)
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

#### On Linux
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp`.
2. Compile with `g++`, linking SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator_sdl terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- **SDL Window**:
  - Opens a window (80x24 characters, sized by font metrics) displaying a `/bin/sh` prompt.
  - Text is white on a black background, using a monospaced font.
- **Key Input**:
  - Typing printable characters (e.g., `a`, `1`, `@`) sends them to the shell, displayed in the window.
  - Enter sends a newline, Backspace deletes the last character.
  - Ctrl+C interrupts the current command, Ctrl+D exits the emulator.
- **Slave Output**:
  - Shell output (e.g., from `ls`, `echo`) appears in the window, with newlines creating new lines.
  - The buffer scrolls up when exceeding 24 lines.
- **Window Size**:
  - The slave terminal is fixed at 80x24 characters, updated via `SIGWINCH` when the SDL window is resized.
  - Commands like `stty size` report `24 80`.
- **Job Control**:
  - Shell job control works (e.g., `sleep 100 &`, `fg`, `bg`).
  - No "can't access tty" warnings.

### Testing
1. **Key Input**:
   - Type `ls` and press Enter to see directory output.
   - Use Backspace to correct input.
   - Press Ctrl+C to interrupt a command like `sleep 10`.
2. **Slave Output**:
   - Run `echo Hello` or `cat` to verify output displays correctly.
   - Test newlines with `printf "A\nB\nC\n"`.
3. **Window Size**:
   - Resize the SDL window and run `stty size` to confirm `24 80`.
   - Open `vim` to verify it uses the full 80x24 area.
4. **Job Control**:
   - Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg`.
   - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend a command and resume it.

### Notes
- **Font Path**: If the font fails to load, replace the path in `TTF_OpenFont` with a valid monospaced font on your system (e.g., `LiberationMono.ttf` on Linux or another `.ttc` file on macOS).
- **Limitations**:
  - Only basic ASCII characters are handled; ANSI escape sequences (e.g., colors, cursor movement) are not processed. If you need this, I can extend the code.
  - The terminal size is fixed at 80x24 for simplicity. Dynamic resizing based on window size can be added if needed.
  - Special keys (e.g., arrow keys, Tab) are not fully handled; only basic input is supported.
- **Performance**: The text rendering is simple and may flicker on rapid updates. For production use, consider double-buffering or texture caching.
- **Cleanup**: The program terminates the child process with `SIGTERM` and cleans up SDL2 resources on exit.

# Version 7

To implement dynamic resizing in the SDL2-based terminal emulator, we need to allow the slave pseudo-terminal's size (rows and columns) to adjust dynamically based on the SDL2 window's size, which is measured in pixels and converted to character units using the font's metrics. This involves:
1. Updating the slave terminal size (`TIOCSWINSZ`) whenever the SDL2 window is resized, calculating the new rows and columns from the window's pixel dimensions and the font's character width/height.
2. Modifying the `SIGWINCH` handler to use the current window size instead of fixed `max_cols` and `max_rows`.
3. Adjusting the text buffer to accommodate the new terminal dimensions, ensuring proper rendering within the updated bounds.
4. Handling SDL2 window resize events (`SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED`) to trigger the size update and notify the shell.
5. Maintaining all existing functionality (key handling, slave output processing, job control, Linux/macOS compatibility).

### Approach
- **Window Size Calculation**: On window resize, get the SDL2 window's pixel dimensions (`SDL_GetWindowSize`) and compute the number of columns and rows by dividing by the font's `char_width` and `char_height`.
- **Slave Terminal Update**: Use `ioctl(master_fd, TIOCSWINSZ)` to set the slave terminal's size and send `SIGWINCH` to the child process to notify the shell.
- **Text Buffer**: Dynamically adjust the text buffer's line lengths and total lines to match the current terminal dimensions, trimming or padding as needed.
- **Rendering**: Update the rendering loop to use the current rows and columns for text display.
- **Event Handling**: Process `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED` to trigger the size update immediately.

### Updated Code
The following C++ code extends the previous SDL2 terminal emulator to support dynamic resizing while preserving all prior functionality. It remains compatible with Linux and macOS.

### Key Changes
1. **Dynamic Terminal Size**:
   - Replaced fixed `max_cols` and `max_rows` with dynamic `term_cols` and `term_rows`, initialized to 80x24 but updated on resize.
   - Added `update_terminal_size` function to:
     - Get the SDL window's pixel size (`SDL_GetWindowSize`).
     - Calculate `term_cols = win_width / char_width` and `term_rows = win_height / char_height`.
     - Set the slave terminal size using `ioctl(master_fd, TIOCSWINSZ)`.
     - Send `SIGWINCH` to the child process.
     - Adjust the text buffer to fit the new `term_cols` and `term_rows`.

2. **SIGWINCH Handler**:
   - Updated `handle_sigwinch` to call `update_terminal_size`, which uses the current SDL window size instead of fixed dimensions.
   - Triggered by both `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED` and external `SIGWINCH` signals (e.g., if the window manager sends them).

3. **Text Buffer Management**:
   - Modified the text buffer to limit each line to `term_cols` characters and the total lines to `term_rows`.
   - On resize, trimmed oversized lines and removed excess lines to fit the new dimensions.

4. **Rendering**:
   - Updated `render_text` to use `term_rows` for the rendering loop, ensuring only the current terminal height is displayed.
   - Kept the same rendering logic (white text on black background).

5. **Event Handling**:
   - Ensured `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED` triggers `update_terminal_size` immediately, updating the slave terminal and text buffer.

   ```

### Expected Behavior
- **SDL Window**:
  - Opens a window (initially 80x24 characters) with a `/bin/sh` prompt.
  - Resizing the window dynamically adjusts the slave terminal size (rows and columns).
- **Dynamic Resizing**:
  - Resizing the SDL window updates `term_cols` and `term_rows` based on pixel dimensions divided by `char_width` and `char_height`.
  - The slave terminal size is updated via `ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ)`, and the shell is notified with `SIGWINCH`.
  - Commands like `stty size` reflect the new dimensions (e.g., `30 100` after resizing).
- **Text Buffer**:
  - Lines are trimmed to `term_cols`, and the buffer is limited to `term_rows` lines.
  - Output adjusts to the new size without distortion.
- **Key Input**:
  - Typing, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+D work as before.
- **Slave Output**:
  - Shell output (e.g., `ls`, `echo`) displays correctly, respecting the new terminal size.
- **Job Control**:
  - Job control (e.g., `sleep 100 &`, `fg`, `bg`) and signal handling (Ctrl+C) work as before.
  - No "can't access tty" warnings.

### Testing
1. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Resize the SDL window (drag or maximize) and run `stty size` to verify the reported rows and columns match the window size (e.g., `30 100` for a larger window).
   - Open `vim` or `top` and resize the window to confirm they adjust to the new dimensions.
   - Check debug output (e.g., `Updated slave size to 100x30`) to confirm `ioctl` success.
2. **Text Rendering**:
   - Run `ls -l` or `cat` to ensure output wraps and scrolls correctly within the new terminal size.
   - Test with `printf "A\nB\nC\n"` to verify line handling.
3. **Key Input**:
   - Type commands and use Backspace, Enter, Ctrl+C to confirm input works.
   - Press Ctrl+D to exit cleanly.
4. **Job Control**:
   - Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg` to manage jobs.
   - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend a command and resume it.

### Notes
- **Font Path**: If the font fails to load, update the `TTF_OpenFont` path to a valid monospaced font (e.g., `LiberationMono.ttf` on Linux or another `.ttc` on macOS).
- **Limitations**:
  - Still handles only basic ASCII; ANSI escape sequences (colors, cursor movement) are not supported. I can add this if needed.
  - Special keys (e.g., arrow keys, Tab) are not fully handled; only basic input is supported.
  - Resizing may cause minor visual glitches if the shell outputs rapidly; a more robust renderer could be added.
- **Performance**: The rendering is simple and may flicker on rapid updates. For production, consider texture caching or double-buffering.
- **Debug Output**: Check `std::cerr` messages for resize events or errors (e.g., `ioctl` failures).

# Version 8

To enable antialiasing in the SDL2-based terminal emulator, we need to improve the text rendering quality by using SDL_ttf's antialiasing capabilities. By default, `TTF_RenderText_Solid` produces aliased (non-antialiased) text, which can look jagged, especially with larger font sizes. To enable antialiasing, we can use `TTF_RenderText_Blended` or `TTF_RenderText_Shaded`, which produce smoother text by blending pixel edges.

### Approach
- **Switch to `TTF_RenderText_Blended`**: This function renders text with antialiasing, producing high-quality, smooth text suitable for a black background (as used in the terminal emulator). It’s preferred over `TTF_RenderText_Shaded`, which requires a separate background color and is less flexible.
- **Maintain Existing Functionality**: Ensure the change to antialiased rendering doesn’t affect dynamic resizing, key handling, slave output processing, job control, or Linux/macOS compatibility.
- **Performance Consideration**: Antialiased text rendering is slightly slower than aliased rendering, but for a terminal emulator with moderate update rates, the impact should be minimal.
- **Font Rendering**: Keep the same font and size, ensuring the character width/height metrics (`char_width`, `char_height`) remain accurate for dynamic resizing calculations.

### Updated Code
The following C++ code modifies the previous SDL2 terminal emulator to use `TTF_RenderText_Blended` for antialiased text rendering. Only the `render_text` function is updated, as the rest of the code (pseudo-terminal, key handling, dynamic resizing, etc.) remains unchanged.

### Key Changes
1. **Antialiased Text Rendering**:
   - Replaced `TTF_RenderText_Solid` with `TTF_RenderText_Blended` in the `render_text` function:
     ```cpp
     SDL_Surface* surface = TTF_RenderText_Blended(font, text_buffer[i].c_str(), white);
     ```
   - `TTF_RenderText_Blended` renders text with antialiasing, producing smoother edges by blending pixels with the background (black in this case).
   - No changes to the rendering loop’s logic (still renders each line at `i * char_height` with white text on a black background).

2. **No Other Changes**:
   - The rest of the code (pseudo-terminal setup, key handling, dynamic resizing, signal handling, text buffer management) remains identical to the previous version.
   - Antialiasing only affects the visual quality of text rendering and does not impact functionality like terminal size updates, job control, or input/output.

### How to Compile and Run
#### Prerequisites
- SDL2 and SDL_ttf installed:
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`
  - **macOS**: `brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf`
- Monospaced font available:
  - Linux: `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf` (or install `fonts-dejavu`).
  - macOS: `/System/Library/Fonts/Menlo.ttc` (built-in).
  - Adjust the font path in `TTF_OpenFont` if needed.

#### On macOS
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp`.
2. Compile with `clang++`, linking SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
   ```bash
   clang++ -o terminal_emulator_sdl terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
   ```
   (Adjust paths if Homebrew installed SDL2 elsewhere, e.g., `/opt/homebrew`.)
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

#### On Linux
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp`.
2. Compile with `g++`, linking SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator_sdl terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- **Antialiased Text**:
  - Text in the SDL window (e.g., shell prompt, command output) appears smoother with antialiased edges, improving readability, especially for larger font sizes or high-resolution displays.
  - The visual quality is noticeably better than the previous aliased rendering (`TTF_RenderText_Solid`), with no jagged edges.
- **SDL Window**:
  - Opens a window (initially 80x24 characters) with a `/bin/sh` prompt, using white antialiased text on a black background.
  - Resizing the window dynamically adjusts the slave terminal size (rows and columns).
- **Dynamic Resizing**:
  - Resizing the SDL window updates `term_cols` and `term_rows` based on pixel dimensions divided by `char_width` and `char_height`.
  - Commands like `stty size` reflect the new dimensions (e.g., `30 100` after resizing).
- **Key Input**:
  - Typing, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+D work as before.
- **Slave Output**:
  - Shell output (e.g., `ls`, `echo`) displays correctly with antialiased text, respecting the terminal size.
- **Job Control**:
  - Job control (e.g., `sleep 100 &`, `fg`, `bg`) and signal handling (Ctrl+C) work as before.
  - No "can't access tty" warnings.

### Testing
1. **Antialiased Rendering**:
   - Run the emulator and type `ls` or `echo Hello` to verify that text appears smooth and antialiased.
   - Compare with the previous version to confirm improved text quality (no jagged edges).
   - Test with different font sizes (e.g., change `TTF_OpenFont` size from 16 to 24) to ensure antialiasing scales well.
2. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Resize the SDL window and run `stty size` to verify the slave terminal’s dimensions update (e.g., `30 100`).
   - Open `vim` or `top` and resize to confirm they adjust to the new size with smooth text.
3. **Text Rendering**:
   - Run `printf "A\nB\nC\n"` or `cat` to ensure output wraps and scrolls correctly with antialiased text.
4. **Key Input**:
   - Type commands, use Backspace, Enter, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+D to confirm input functionality.
5. **Job Control**:
   - Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg`.
   - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend and resume commands.

### Notes
- **Font Path**: If the font fails to load, update the `TTF_OpenFont` path to a valid monospaced font (e.g., `LiberationMono.ttf` on Linux or another `.ttc` on macOS).
- **Performance**: Antialiased rendering (`TTF_RenderText_Blended`) is slightly slower than `TTF_RenderText_Solid`, but the impact is negligible for typical terminal use. For high-performance needs, texture caching could be added.
- **Limitations**:
  - Still handles only basic ASCII; ANSI escape sequences (e.g., colors, cursor movement) are not supported. I can add this if needed.
  - Special keys (e.g., arrow keys, Tab) are not fully handled; only basic input is supported.
  - Minor flickering may occur on rapid updates; a double-buffered renderer could improve this.
- **Debug Output**: Check `std::cerr` for resize events or errors (e.g., `ioctl` failures).

# Version 8

To implement a double-buffered renderer in the SDL2-based terminal emulator, we need to optimize the rendering process to reduce flickering and improve performance. Double buffering involves maintaining two buffers: one for rendering (back buffer) and one for display (front buffer). SDL2 inherently supports double buffering when using a renderer with `SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED`, but we can enhance the rendering pipeline by:
1. Pre-rendering text textures for each line in the text buffer and caching them to avoid redundant rendering.
2. Using a separate rendering pass to update the back buffer, then swapping it with the front buffer using `SDL_RenderPresent`.
3. Ensuring the double-buffered approach integrates with the existing antialiased text rendering (`TTF_RenderText_Blended`), dynamic resizing, key handling, and pseudo-terminal logic.
4. Maintaining compatibility with Linux and macOS.

### Approach
- **Texture Caching**: Create a cache of SDL textures for each line in the `text_buffer`, updating only when the line’s content changes or the terminal size changes.
- **Double-Buffered Rendering**: Modify `render_text` to:
  - Clear the back buffer.
  - Copy cached textures to the back buffer.
  - Present the back buffer to the screen (swapping with the front buffer).
- **Buffer Management**: Track dirty lines (those that have changed) to update only necessary textures, minimizing rendering overhead.
- **Integration**: Ensure the double-buffered renderer works with dynamic resizing (updating textures on size changes) and maintains antialiased text quality.
- **Performance**: Reduce CPU/GPU load by avoiding redundant `TTF_RenderText_Blended` calls and leveraging SDL2’s hardware-accelerated rendering.

### Updated Code
The following C++ code modifies the SDL2 terminal emulator to implement a double-buffered renderer with texture caching. The `render_text` function is updated, and a texture cache is added, while all other functionality (antialiased text, dynamic resizing, key handling, pseudo-terminal logic) remains unchanged.

### Key Changes
1. **Texture Cache**:
   - Added `texture_cache` (vector of `SDL_Texture*`) to store pre-rendered textures for each line in `text_buffer`.
   - Added `dirty_lines` (vector of `bool`) to track which lines have changed and need their textures updated.
   - Initialized `texture_cache` and `dirty_lines` with the text buffer (one empty line, marked dirty).

2. **Double-Buffered Rendering**:
   - Updated `render_text` to:
     - Update textures only for dirty lines using `TTF_RenderText_Blended` (antialiased).
     - Destroy old textures before creating new ones to avoid memory leaks.
     - Clear the back buffer with a black background.
     - Copy cached textures to the back buffer using `SDL_RenderCopy`.
     - Present the back buffer with `SDL_RenderPresent`, swapping it with the front buffer.
   - Marked lines as clean (`dirty_lines[i] = false`) after updating their textures.

3. **Text Buffer Updates**:
   - Modified the pseudo-terminal output loop to mark lines as dirty (`dirty_lines.back() = true`) when characters are added, removed, or cleared (e.g., `\n`, `\r`, `\b`, printable chars).
   - Ensured `texture_cache` and `dirty_lines` stay synchronized with `text_buffer` during insertions (e.g., newlines) and deletions (e.g., trimming on resize).

4. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Updated `update_terminal_size` to resize `texture_cache` and `dirty_lines` alongside `text_buffer`, marking all lines dirty to force texture updates after a resize.
   - Destroyed textures for removed lines to prevent memory leaks.

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Added cleanup for `texture_cache` in the main loop’s exit path, destroying all textures to free resources.

   ```
   (Adjust paths if Homebrew installed SDL2 elsewhere, e.g., `/opt/homebrew`.)
3. Run the program:

   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- **Double-Buffered Rendering**:
  - Text rendering is flicker-free, even during rapid updates (e.g., scrolling output from `cat` or `ls -R`).
  - Textures are cached and reused for unchanged lines, reducing rendering overhead.
  - Antialiased text (via `TTF_RenderText_Blended`) remains smooth and high-quality.
- **SDL Window**:
  - Opens a window (initially 80x24 characters) with a `/bin/sh` prompt, using white antialiased text on a black background.
  - Resizing the window dynamically adjusts the slave terminal size.
- **Dynamic Resizing**:
  - Resizing updates `term_cols` and `term_rows`, and textures are regenerated for all lines (marked dirty).
  - Commands like `stty size` reflect the new dimensions (e.g., `30 100`).
- **Key Input**:
  - Typing, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+D work as before.
- **Slave Output**:
  - Shell output (e.g., `ls`, `echo`) displays correctly with smooth, flicker-free rendering.
- **Job Control**:
  - Job control (e.g., `sleep 100 &`, `fg`, `bg`) and signal handling (Ctrl+C) work as before.
  - No "can't access tty" warnings.

### Testing
1. **Double-Buffered Rendering**:
   - Run `ls -R` or `cat large_file.txt` to verify that output scrolls without flickering.
   - Type rapidly (e.g., hold a key) to ensure input updates are smooth.
   - Compare with the previous version to confirm reduced or eliminated flickering.
2. **Antialiased Text**:
   - Verify that text remains smooth and antialiased (no jagged edges).
   - Test with larger font sizes (e.g., change `TTF_OpenFont` size to 24) to ensure quality.
3. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Resize the SDL window and run `stty size` to confirm updated dimensions (e.g., `30 100`).
   - Open `vim` or `top` and resize to verify they adjust with smooth rendering.
4. **Text Rendering**:
   - Run `printf "A\nB\nC\n"` or `cat` to ensure output wraps and scrolls correctly.
5. **Key Input**:
   - Type commands, use Backspace, Enter, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+D to confirm functionality.
6. **Job Control**:
   - Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg`.
   - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend and resume commands.

### Notes
- **Font Path**: If the font fails to load, update the `TTF_OpenFont` path to a valid monospaced font (e.g., `LiberationMono.ttf` on Linux or another `.ttc` on macOS).
- **Performance**: The double-buffered renderer with texture caching significantly reduces flickering and improves efficiency by avoiding redundant text rendering. For even higher performance, we could cache textures across frames more aggressively or use a glyph atlas.
- **Limitations**:
  - Still handles only basic ASCII; ANSI escape sequences (e.g., colors, cursor movement) are not supported. I can add this if needed.
  - Special keys (e.g., arrow keys, Tab) are not fully handled; only basic input is supported.
- **Debug Output**: Check `std::cerr` for resize events or errors (e.g., `ioctl` failures).

# Version 9

To implement ANSI escape sequence support in the SDL2-based terminal emulator, we need to parse and handle ANSI escape codes to support features like text colors, cursor movement, and text attributes (e.g., bold, underline). ANSI escape sequences are used by many terminal applications (e.g., `ls --color`, `vim`, `top`) to control formatting and positioning. This involves:
1. Parsing ANSI escape sequences (e.g., `\033[...m` for colors, `\033[...H` for cursor movement) from the slave pseudo-terminal’s output.
2. Rendering text with appropriate colors and attributes using SDL_ttf.
3. Managing a virtual cursor position to handle cursor movement commands.
4. Maintaining the existing double-buffered renderer, antialiased text, dynamic resizing, key handling, and pseudo-terminal logic.
5. Ensuring compatibility with Linux and macOS.

### Approach
- **ANSI Parsing**:
  - Implement a state machine to parse ANSI escape sequences (starting with `\033[` or ESC `[`) and extract parameters (e.g., `31` for red foreground in `\033[31m`).
  - Support common sequences: SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) for colors/attributes, cursor movement (e.g., CUP, Cursor Position), and clear screen/line.
- **Rendering**:
  - Extend the text buffer to store per-character attributes (color, bold, etc.).
  - Modify the double-buffered renderer to apply colors and attributes when rendering textures.
  - Use SDL_ttf’s `TTF_SetFontStyle` for bold and underline (if supported by the font).
- **Cursor Management**:
  - Track a virtual cursor position (row, column) for rendering and cursor movement commands.
  - Handle cursor movement sequences (e.g., `\033[H`, `\033[A`) and ensure rendering respects the cursor.
- **Integration**:
  - Update the output processing loop to parse ANSI sequences before updating the text buffer.
  - Ensure dynamic resizing updates the cursor and buffer correctly.
- **Limitations**:
  - Focus on common ANSI sequences (SGR, cursor movement, clear) to keep the implementation manageable.
  - Ignore less common sequences (e.g., mouse events, complex modes) for simplicity.

### Updated Code
The following C++ code extends the SDL2 terminal emulator to support ANSI escape sequences, including colors, bold, cursor movement, and basic screen/line clearing. The code maintains double-buffered rendering, antialiased text, dynamic resizing, and all prior functionality.

### Key Changes
1. **Text Buffer with Attributes**:
   - Replaced `std::vector<std::string>` with `std::vector<std::vector<Char>>`, where `Char` contains a character and its attributes (`CharAttr`: foreground/background color, bold, underline).
   - Initialized `text_buffer` with `term_rows` lines, each containing `term_cols` `Char` objects with default attributes.

2. **ANSI Parsing**:
   - Added `AnsiState` enum and state machine (`NORMAL`, `ESCAPE`, `CSI`) to parse escape sequences.
   - Implemented `process_ansi_sequence` to handle:
     - **SGR (m)**: Colors (30–37, 40–47, 90–97, 100–107), bold (1), underline (4), reset (0).
     - **Cursor Movement**: CUP (`H`), CUU (`A`), CUD (`B`), CUF (`C`), CUB (`D`).
     - **Erase**: ED (`J`, clear screen), EL (`K`, clear line).
   - Updated the output loop to parse ANSI sequences and apply them to `current_attr` or cursor position.

3. **Rendering**:
   - Modified `render_text` to:
     - Build a string and extract attributes for each line from `text_buffer`.
     - Render the line with the first character’s foreground color using `TTF_RenderText_Blended` (antialiased).
     - Apply bold/underline via `TTF_SetFontStyle` if present (reset afterward).
     - Cache the texture and copy to the back buffer.
   - Simplified rendering to use one texture per line with the first character’s attributes (for simplicity; per-character colors would require splitting lines).

4. **Cursor Management**:
   - Added `Cursor` struct to track `row` and `col`, updated by ANSI sequences and character output.
   - Handled cursor positioning in output processing (e.g., `\n`, `\r`, `\b`, printable chars).
   - Clamped cursor position during resizing to stay within `term_rows` and `term_cols`.

5. **Output Processing**:
   - Updated the pseudo-terminal output loop to:
     - Parse ANSI sequences using the state machine.
     - Insert printable characters at the cursor position with `current_attr`.
     - Handle newlines, carriage returns, and backspaces with cursor updates.
     - Scroll the buffer when the cursor exceeds `term_rows`.
   - Marked affected lines as dirty (`dirty_lines`) for texture updates.

6. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Updated `update_terminal_size` to resize `text_buffer` to `term_rows` x `term_cols` `Char` objects, preserving attributes.
   - Adjusted `texture_cache` and `dirty_lines`, marking all lines dirty after a resize.

  - Attributes: Bold and underline work if the font supports them (e.g., `echo -e "\033[1mBold\033[0m"`).
  - Cursor Movement: Commands like `tput cup 5 10` position the cursor correctly.
  - Clear: `clear` (`\033[2J`) clears the screen, `tput el` (`\033[K`) clears the line.
- **Rendering**:
  - Text is rendered with antialiasing (`TTF_RenderText_Blended`) and double buffering, ensuring smooth, flicker-free display.
  - Each line uses the first character’s color and attributes (simplified rendering).
- **SDL Window**:
  - Opens a window (initially 80x24 characters) with a `/bin/sh` prompt.
  - Resizing dynamically adjusts the slave terminal size.
- **Dynamic Resizing**:
  - Resizing updates `term_cols` and `term_rows`, and `stty size` reflects the new dimensions.
- **Key Input**:
  - Typing, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+D work as before.
- **Slave Output**:
  - Shell output with ANSI sequences (e.g., `ls --color`, `vim`) displays correctly with colors and cursor positioning.
- **Job Control**:
  - Job control (`sleep 100 &`, `fg`, `bg`) and signal handling (Ctrl+C) work as before.
  - No "can't access tty" warnings.

### Testing
1. **ANSI Colors**:
   - Run `ls --color` to verify colored output (e.g., blue directories, green executables).
   - Test with `echo -e "\033[31mRed\033[32mGreen\033[0m"` to confirm color changes.
2. **Text Attributes**:
   - Run `echo -e "\033[1mBold\033[4mUnderline\033[0m"` to verify bold and underline (font-dependent).
3. **Cursor Movement**:
   - Run `tput cup 5 10; echo X` to place an `X` at row 5, column 10.
   - Test `tput cuu 1` or `tput cud 1` to move the cursor up/down.
4. **Clear Commands**:
   - Run `clear` to clear the screen.
   - Run `tput el` to clear the current line.
5. **Rendering**:
   - Run `vim` or `top` to verify colored output and cursor positioning with smooth rendering.
   - Check for flicker-free updates during rapid output (e.g., `cat large_file.txt`).
6. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Resize the window and run `stty size` to confirm updated dimensions.
   - Verify `vim` adjusts to the new size with correct colors.
7. **Key Input**:
   - Type commands, use Backspace, Enter, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+D.
8. **Job Control**:
   - Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg`.
   - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend and resume.

### Notes
- **Font Path**: Update `TTF_OpenFont` if the font fails to load (e.g., use `LiberationMono.ttf` on Linux or another `.ttc` on macOS).
- **Rendering Limitation**:
  - Each line uses a single color/attribute (first character’s) to simplify rendering. Per-character colors would require rendering individual glyphs, which is more complex but possible if needed.
  - Bold/underline depend on font support; some fonts (e.g., DejaVu Sans Mono) may not render these correctly.
- **ANSI Support**:
  - Supports common sequences (SGR, cursor movement, clear). Less common sequences (e.g., mouse events, alternate screens) are ignored but can be added.
  - The parser is basic and assumes well-formed sequences; malformed sequences are skipped.
- **Performance**: The double-buffered renderer with texture caching ensures smooth updates. Per-character rendering could be added for full color support but may impact performance.
- **Special Keys**: Arrow keys and other special keys are not fully handled; only basic input is supported.

# Version 10

To implement support for arrow keys, Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up, Page Down, and F1–F12 keys in the SDL2-based terminal emulator, we need to:
1. Capture SDL2 key events for these special keys and map them to the appropriate ANSI escape sequences or control codes expected by the shell (`/bin/sh`).
2. Send these sequences to the slave pseudo-terminal (`master_fd`) to allow applications like `bash`, `vim`, or `less` to interpret them correctly.
3. Ensure the existing functionality (ANSI escape sequence parsing, double-buffered rendering, antialiased text, dynamic resizing, job control, and Linux/macOS compatibility) remains intact.

### Approach
- **Key Mapping**:
  - Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right): Map to ANSI escape sequences (e.g., `\033[A` for Up).
  - Home, End, Insert, Delete: Map to standard terminal sequences (e.g., `\033[H` for Home, `\033[P` for Delete).
  - Page Up, Page Down: Map to sequences like `\033[5~` and `\033[6~`.
  - F1–F12: Map to sequences like `\033[11~` to `\033[23~` (varies by terminal type).
- **SDL2 Key Handling**:
  - Update the `SDL_KEYDOWN` event handler to detect these keys using `SDLK_` constants (e.g., `SDLK_UP`, `SDLK_HOME`, `SDLK_F1`).
  - Send the corresponding escape sequences to `master_fd` using `write`.
- **Integration**:
  - Preserve existing key handling (printable characters, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D).
  - Ensure ANSI parsing, rendering, and cursor management are unaffected.
- **Terminal Compatibility**:
  - Use sequences compatible with common terminals (e.g., xterm, vt100) to ensure `bash`, `vim`, and other applications interpret them correctly.
  - Account for slight variations in sequence interpretation across Linux and macOS shells.

### Key Mappings
The following mappings are based on standard xterm/vt100 escape sequences, which are widely supported by shells and applications:
- **Arrow Keys**:
  - Up: `\033[A`
  - Down: `\033[B`
  - Right: `\033[C`
  - Left: `\033[D`
- **Home/End**:
  - Home: `\033[H`
  - End: `\033[F`
- **Insert/Delete**:
  - Insert: `\033[2~`
  - Delete: `\033[3~`
- **Page Up/Page Down**:
  - Page Up: `\033[5~`
  - Page Down: `\033[6~`
- **Function Keys (F1–F12)**:
  - F1: `\033[11~`
  - F2: `\033[12~`
  - F3: `\033[13~`
  - F4: `\033[14~`
  - F5: `\033[15~`
  - F6: `\033[17~`
  - F7: `\033[18~`
  - F8: `\033[19~`
  - F9: `\033[20~`
  - F10: `\033[21~`
  - F11: `\033[23~`
  - F12: `\033[24~`

### Updated Code
The following C++ code extends the previous SDL2 terminal emulator to support the specified special keys by updating the key event handler. All other functionality (ANSI escape sequences, double-buffered rendering, dynamic resizing, etc.) remains unchanged.

### Key Changes
1. **Special Key Handling**:
   - Updated the `SDL_KEYDOWN` event handler in the main loop to detect special keys using `SDLK_` constants.
   - Added a `switch` statement to map keys to their ANSI escape sequences:
     - Arrow keys: `SDLK_UP` → `\033[A`, `SDLK_DOWN` → `\033[B`, etc.
     - Home/End: `SDLK_HOME` → `\033[H`, `SDLK_END` → `\033[F`.
     - Insert/Delete: `SDLK_INSERT` → `\033[2~`, `SDLK_DELETE` → `\033[3~`.
     - Page Up/Down: `SDLK_PAGEUP` → `\033[5~`, `SDLK_PAGEDOWN` → `\033[6~`.
     - F1–F12: `SDLK_F1` → `\033[11~`, `SDLK_F2` → `\033[12~`, ..., `SDLK_F12` → `\033[24~`.
   - Preserved existing handling for printable characters, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+D.
   - Used `write(master_fd, input.c_str(), input.size())` to send sequences to the slave pseudo-terminal.

2. **No Other Changes**:
   - The rest of the code (ANSI escape sequence parsing, double-buffered rendering, antialiased text, dynamic resizing, cursor management, job control) remains identical.
   - The key handling update only affects the input processing in the SDL event loop.

# Version 11

To show the cursor position as a blinking rectangle in the SDL2-based terminal emulator, we need to:
1. Render a blinking rectangular cursor at the current cursor position (`cursor.row`, `cursor.col`) in the SDL2 window, using the font's character dimensions (`char_width`, `char_height`) to size and position it.
2. Implement blinking by toggling the cursor's visibility based on a timer (e.g., blinking every 500ms).
3. Integrate the cursor rendering into the existing double-buffered renderer, ensuring it works with ANSI escape sequences, special key support (arrow keys, Home, etc.), antialiased text, dynamic resizing, and pseudo-terminal logic.
4. Ensure compatibility with Linux and macOS, maintaining all prior functionality.

### Approach
- **Cursor Rendering**:
  - Draw a filled rectangle at the cursor’s position (`cursor.col * char_width`, `cursor.row * char_height`) using `SDL_RenderFillRect`.
  - Use a distinct color (e.g., white) to make the cursor visible against the black background and colored text.
- **Blinking Effect**:
  - Track the cursor’s visibility state (`cursor_visible`) and toggle it every 500ms using `SDL_GetTicks` to measure elapsed time.
  - Update the rendering loop to draw the cursor only when `cursor_visible` is true.
- **Integration**:
  - Add cursor rendering to the `render_text` function, after copying cached textures but before presenting the back buffer.
  - Ensure the cursor position is updated correctly by ANSI sequences and special key inputs (e.g., arrow keys, Home).
  - Adjust for dynamic resizing by recalculating the cursor’s pixel position based on the updated `term_cols`, `term_rows`, and font metrics.
- **Preserve Functionality**:
  - Maintain ANSI escape sequence parsing, double-buffered rendering, antialiased text, special key handling, and job control.
  - Ensure the cursor does not interfere with text rendering or terminal behavior.

### Updated Code
The following C++ code extends the previous SDL2 terminal emulator to render a blinking rectangular cursor. The `render_text` function is updated to include cursor rendering, and new variables are added to manage blinking. All other functionality (ANSI support, special keys, dynamic resizing, etc.) remains unchanged.

### Key Changes
1. **Cursor Blinking**:
   - Added global variables:
     - `cursor_visible` (`bool`): Tracks whether the cursor is visible.
     - `last_cursor_toggle` (`Uint32`): Stores the time of the last cursor toggle (in milliseconds).
     - `cursor_blink_interval` (`const Uint32`): Set to 500ms for blinking every 0.5 seconds.
   - In `render_text`, updated the cursor state using `SDL_GetTicks`:
     ```cpp
     Uint32 current_time = SDL_GetTicks();
     if (current_time - last_cursor_toggle >= cursor_blink_interval) {
         cursor_visible = !cursor_visible;
         last_cursor_toggle = current_time;
     }
     ```
   - This toggles `cursor_visible` every 500ms.

2. **Cursor Rendering**:
   - Added cursor rendering in `render_text`, after copying cached textures but before `SDL_RenderPresent`:
     ```cpp
     if (cursor_visible && cursor.row < term_rows && cursor.col < term_cols) {
         SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 255, 255, 255, 255); // White cursor
         SDL_Rect cursor_rect = {
             cursor.col * char_width,
             cursor.row * char_height,
             char_width,
             char_height
         };
         SDL_RenderFillRect(renderer, &cursor_rect);
     }
     ```
   - The cursor is a white filled rectangle sized `char_width` x `char_height`, positioned at `(cursor.col * char_width, cursor.row * char_height)`.
   - Only drawn when `cursor_visible` is true and the cursor is within bounds.

3. **No Other Changes**:
   - The rest of the code (ANSI escape sequence parsing, double-buffered rendering, antialiased text, dynamic resizing, special key handling, job control) remains identical.
   - The cursor rendering is a visual addition and does not affect terminal behavior or input/output.

### How to Compile and Run
#### Prerequisites
- SDL2 and SDL_ttf installed:
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`
  - **macOS**: `brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf`
- Monospaced font available:
  - Linux: `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf` (or install `fonts-dejavu`).
  - macOS: `/System/Library/Fonts/Menlo.ttc` (built-in).
  - Adjust the font path in `TTF_OpenFont` if needed.

#### On macOS
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp`.
2. Compile with `clang++`, linking SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
   ```bash
   clang++ -o terminal_emulator_sdl terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
   ```
   (Adjust paths if Homebrew installed SDL2 elsewhere, e.g., `/opt/homebrew`.)
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

#### On Linux
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp`.
2. Compile with `g++`, linking SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator_sdl terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- **Blinking Cursor**:
  - A white rectangular cursor appears at the current cursor position (e.g., after the `bash` prompt).
  - The cursor blinks every 500ms (on for 500ms, off for 500ms), creating a standard terminal cursor effect.
  - The cursor moves with input (e.g., typing, arrow keys, Home) and ANSI cursor commands (e.g., `tput cup 5 10`).
- **Rendering**:
  - The cursor is rendered over the text, ensuring visibility against the black background and colored text.
  - Text remains antialiased with double buffering, maintaining flicker-free display with ANSI colors and attributes.
- **SDL Window**:
  - Opens a window (initially 80x24 characters) with a `/bin/sh` prompt and blinking cursor.
  - Resizing dynamically adjusts the slave terminal size, and the cursor scales correctly.
- **Dynamic Resizing**:
  - Resizing updates `term_cols` and `term_rows`, and `stty size` reflects the new dimensions.
  - The cursor remains at the correct position, clamped to the new bounds.
- **Key Input**:
  - Printable characters, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, and special keys (arrow, Home, End, etc.) work as before.
  - Arrow keys and cursor movement commands update the cursor’s position, and the blinking rectangle follows.
- **Slave Output**:
  - Shell output with ANSI sequences (e.g., `ls --color`, `vim`) displays with colors, and the cursor blinks at the correct position.
- **Job Control**:
  - Job control (`sleep 100 &`, `fg`, `bg`) and signal handling (Ctrl+C) work as before.
  - No "can't access tty" warnings.

### Testing
1. **Blinking Cursor**:
   - Run the emulator and verify a white rectangular cursor blinks at the `bash` prompt (on/off every 500ms).
   - Type text (e.g., `echo test`) and confirm the cursor moves right, blinking at each new position.
   - Press arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the cursor in `bash` or `vim`, ensuring the blinking rectangle follows.
   - Use `tput cup 5 10; echo X` to position the cursor at row 5, column 10, and verify the rectangle blinks there.
2. **Cursor with Special Keys**:
   - In `vim`, use Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up/Down, and F1–F12, checking that the cursor blinks at the updated position.
   - In `less file.txt`, press Page Up/Down and verify the cursor remains visible and blinking.
3. **ANSI Colors**:
   - Run `ls --color` to verify colored output with the blinking cursor visible.
   - Test `echo -e "\033[31mRed\033[0m"` and ensure the cursor blinks after the output.
4. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Resize the window and run `stty size` to confirm dimensions.
   - Verify the cursor blinks at the correct position in `vim` or `bash` after resizing.
5. **Rendering**:
   - Run `vim` or `top` to check flicker-free rendering with the blinking cursor.
   - Ensure the cursor is visible over text and does not obscure characters.
6. **Job Control**:
   - Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg`, confirming the cursor blinks correctly.
   - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend and resume, checking cursor behavior.

### Notes
- **Font Path**: Update `TTF_OpenFont` if the font fails to load (e.g., `LiberationMono.ttf` on Linux or another `.ttc` on macOS).
- **Cursor Appearance**:
  - The cursor is a solid white rectangle for visibility. If you prefer a different style (e.g., underscore, vertical bar, or different color), I can adjust it.
  - Blinking at 500ms matches common terminal behavior; I can change the interval if desired.
- **Rendering Limitation**:
  - Each line uses a single color/attribute (first character’s). Per-character colors require a more complex renderer, which I can implement if needed.
- **Performance**: The cursor rendering adds minimal overhead, and double buffering ensures flicker-free updates.
- **Special Keys**: All requested keys (arrow, Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up/Down, F1–F12) are supported. Additional keys (e.g., Tab, Alt-modified keys) can be added if required.

# Version 12

To implement per-character color support in the SDL2-based terminal emulator, we need to modify the rendering system to handle individual character colors and attributes, as specified by ANSI escape sequences. Currently, each line is rendered with a single color and attribute (based on the first character), which limits the emulator's ability to display text with varying colors within a line (e.g., in `vim` syntax highlighting or `ls --color` with mixed colors). This involves:
1. Rendering each character (or span of characters with the same attributes) separately, using SDL_ttf to create textures for individual characters or segments.
2. Updating the double-buffered renderer to composite these per-character textures onto the back buffer.
3. Preserving the blinking cursor, ANSI escape sequence parsing, special key support (arrow keys, Home, etc.), dynamic resizing, antialiased text, and pseudo-terminal logic.
4. Ensuring compatibility with Linux and macOS, maintaining all prior functionality.

### Approach
- **Text Buffer**: Continue using `std::vector<std::vector<Char>>`, where `Char` contains a character and its attributes (`CharAttr`: foreground/background color, bold, underline). This already stores per-character attributes.
- **Rendering**:
  - Instead of rendering each line as a single texture, iterate through each character in a line.
  - Group consecutive characters with identical attributes into "spans" to optimize rendering (avoiding one texture per character).
  - Create a texture for each span using `TTF_RenderText_Blended`, applying the span’s foreground color, bold, and underline attributes.
  - Position each span’s texture at the correct pixel coordinates (`col * char_width`, `row * char_height`).
- **Texture Caching**:
  - Cache textures for each line, but store a vector of textures per line (one per span) instead of a single texture.
  - Update the cache only when a line’s content or attributes change (using `dirty_lines`).
- **Cursor Rendering**:
  - Keep the blinking cursor as a white rectangle, ensuring it renders correctly over per-character colored text.
- **Integration**:
  - Update `render_text` to handle per-character rendering while maintaining double buffering.
  - Ensure dynamic resizing adjusts the texture cache and cursor position correctly.
  - Preserve ANSI parsing, special key handling, and job control.

### Challenges
- **Performance**: Rendering multiple textures per line increases GPU load compared to one texture per line. Using spans minimizes this by grouping characters with the same attributes.
- **Alignment**: Ensure precise positioning of character textures to avoid gaps or overlaps, using `char_width` and `char_height`.
- **Memory**: Manage texture memory carefully, destroying old textures when lines change or the terminal resizes.

### Updated Code
The following C++ code modifies the SDL2 terminal emulator to support per-character colors by rendering spans of characters with the same attributes. The `render_text` function and texture cache are updated, while all other functionality (blinking cursor, ANSI sequences, special keys, dynamic resizing, etc.) remains intact.

### Key Changes
1. **TextSpan Structure**:
   - Added `TextSpan` struct to represent a span of characters with the same attributes:
     ```cpp
     struct TextSpan {
         std::string text;
         CharAttr attr;
         int start_col;
         SDL_Texture* texture = nullptr;
     };
     ```
   - Stores the text, attributes, starting column, and texture for each span.

2. **Texture Cache Update**:
   - Changed `texture_cache` from `std::vector<SDL_Texture*>` to `std::vector<std::vector<TextSpan>>`, where each line contains a list of spans.
   - Initialized `texture_cache` with `term_rows` empty vectors.
   - Updated `update_terminal_size` and output processing to manage `texture_cache` as a vector of span lists.

3. **Per-Character Color Rendering**:
   - Modified `render_text` to:
     - For each dirty line, clear existing textures and build new spans by grouping characters with identical attributes.
     - Compare attributes using a custom `operator==` in `CharAttr` to check foreground/background color, bold, and underline.
     - Render each span with `TTF_RenderText_Blended`, applying the span’s foreground color and bold/underline styles.
     - Store the texture and metadata in `texture_cache[i]`.
     - Copy each span’s texture to the back buffer at `(span.start_col * char_width, i * char_height)`.
   - Example rendering loop:
     ```cpp
     for (const auto& span : texture_cache[i]) {
         if (!span.texture) continue;
         int w, h;
         SDL_QueryTexture(span.texture, nullptr, nullptr, &w, &h);
         SDL_Rect dst = {span.start_col * char_width, static_cast<int>(i * char_height), w, h};
         SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, span.texture, nullptr, &dst);
     }
     ```

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Destroyed old textures when a line is dirty or during resizing to prevent memory leaks.
   - Ensured cleanup of all textures in the exit path:
     ```cpp
     for (auto& line_spans : texture_cache) {
         for (auto& span : line_spans) {
             if (span.texture) SDL_DestroyTexture(span.texture);
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Preserved Functionality**:
   - The blinking cursor remains a white rectangle, rendered after text to ensure visibility.
   - ANSI escape sequence parsing, special key handling (arrow keys, Home, etc.), dynamic resizing, and job control are unchanged.
   - Antialiased text and double buffering are maintained, with spans ensuring smooth rendering.

### How to Compile and Run
#### Prerequisites
- SDL2 and SDL_ttf installed:
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`
  - **macOS**: `brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf`
- Monospaced font available:
  - Linux: `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf` (or install `fonts-dejavu`).
  - macOS: `/System/Library/Fonts/Menlo.ttc` (built-in).
  - Adjust the font path in `TTF_OpenFont` if needed.

#### On macOS
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp`.
2. Compile with `clang++`, linking SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
   ```bash
   clang++ -o terminal_emulator_sdl terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
   ```
   (Adjust paths if Homebrew installed SDL2 elsewhere, e.g., `/opt/homebrew`.)
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

#### On Linux
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp`.
2. Compile with `g++`, linking SDL2 and SDL_ttf:
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator_sdl terminal_emulator_sdl.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator_sdl
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- **Per-Character Colors**:
  - Each character can have its own foreground color, as specified by ANSI escape sequences (e.g., `\033[31m` for red, `\033[32m` for green).
  - Applications like `vim` (with syntax highlighting) or `ls --color` display mixed colors within a line (e.g., blue directories, green executables).
  - Bold and underline attributes are applied per span, if supported by the font.
- **Blinking Cursor**:
  - A white rectangular cursor blinks (500ms on/off) at the current position, visible over colored text.
  - Moves correctly with input, arrow keys, and ANSI cursor commands (e.g., `tput cup 5 10`).
- **Rendering**:
  - Text is antialiased (`TTF_RenderText_Blended`) and rendered flicker-free with double buffering.
  - Spans ensure efficient rendering by grouping characters with the same attributes.
- **SDL Window**:
  - Opens a window (initially 80x24 characters) with a `/bin/sh` prompt and blinking cursor.
  - Resizing dynamically adjusts the slave terminal size.
- **Dynamic Resizing**:
  - Resizing updates `term_cols` and `term_rows`, and `stty size` reflects the new dimensions.
  - Per-character colors and the cursor adjust correctly.
- **Key Input**:
  - Printable characters, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, and special keys (arrow, Home, End, etc.) work as before.
- **Slave Output**:
  - Shell output with ANSI sequences (e.g., `ls --color`, `vim`) displays with per-character colors and correct cursor positioning.
- **Job Control**:
  - Job control (`sleep 100 &`, `fg`, `bg`) and signal handling (Ctrl+C) work as before.
  - No "can't access tty" warnings.

### Testing
1. **Per-Character Colors**:
   - Run `ls --color` to verify mixed colors (e.g., blue directories, green executables, red archives) within a single line.
   - In `vim` with syntax highlighting (e.g., `vim test.py`), confirm keywords, strings, and comments use different colors on the same line.
   - Test with `echo -e "\033[31mRed\033[32mGreen\033[34mBlue\033[0m"` to see multiple colors in one line.
2. **Blinking Cursor**:
   - Verify the white cursor blinks at the `bash` prompt and moves with typing, arrow keys, or `tput cup 5 10`.
   - Ensure the cursor is visible over colored text in `vim` or `ls --color`.
3. **Text Attributes**:
   - Run `echo -e "\033[1mBold\033[4mUnderline\033[0m"` to check bold/underline (font-dependent) with per-character colors.
4. **Special Keys**:
   - In `vim`, use arrow keys, Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up/Down, and F1–F12, ensuring colors and cursor behave correctly.
   - In `less file.txt`, press Page Up/Down and verify scrolling with colored output.
5. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Resize the window and run `stty size` to confirm dimensions.
   - Verify `vim` adjusts with per-character colors and a blinking cursor.
6. **Rendering**:
   - Run `vim` or `top` to check flicker-free rendering with per-character colors.
   - Ensure no gaps or overlaps between character spans.
7. **Job Control**:
   - Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg`, confirming colors and cursor behavior.
   - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend and resume.

### Notes
- **Font Path**: Update `TTF_OpenFont` if the font fails to load (e.g., `LiberationMono.ttf` on Linux or another `.ttc` on macOS).
- **Performance**:
  - Rendering spans increases GPU load but is optimized by grouping characters with the same attributes.
  - For very wide lines with frequent color changes, performance may degrade slightly. A glyph atlas could further optimize this if needed.
- **Rendering Details**:
  - Background colors (`CharAttr::bg`) are not rendered (only foreground colors are used). I can add background color support if desired, though it requires rendering rectangles behind each span.
  - Bold/underline depend on font support; some fonts (e.g., DejaVu Sans Mono) may not render these correctly.
- **ANSI Support**: Supports common sequences (SGR, cursor movement, clear). Additional sequences (e.g., alternate screens) can be added if needed.
- **Special Keys**: All requested keys (arrow, Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up/Down, F1–F12) are supported. Additional keys (e.g., Tab) can be added if required.
