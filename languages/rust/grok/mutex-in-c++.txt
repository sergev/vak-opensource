Q. Please show me a possible implementation of type Mutex<T> in C++.

I'll provide an implementation of a Mutex<T> type in C++ that mimics Rust's Mutex. Rust's Mutex provides mutual exclusion with a lock guard pattern, so we'll create a similar construct in C++ using the standard library's threading primitives.

Here's a possible implementation:

    mutex.cpp

Let's break down the key components:

1. Mutex<T> Class:

    Stores the actual data (T data)
    Contains a std::mutex for synchronization
    Takes an initial value in constructor

2. LockGuard Inner Class:

    Similar to Rust's MutexGuard
    Holds a reference to the data and a std::unique_lock
    Provides access to the underlying data via operators * and ->
    Automatically unlocks when it goes out of scope (RAII)

3. Key Features:

    lock() method returns a LockGuard object
    Copy prevention to avoid race conditions
    Move semantics supported
    Thread-safe access to the contained data

4. Differences from Rust's Mutex:

    C++ doesn't have Rust's ownership system, so we rely on RAII
    No poisoning mechanism (Rust's Mutex can poison on panic)
    Manual lock() call instead of Rust's Option/Result pattern

Usage Notes:

    The LockGuard provides safe access to the data while holding the lock
    The lock is automatically released when the guard goes out of scope
    Multiple threads can safely access the mutex-protected data

You could extend this implementation by:

    Adding try_lock() functionality
    Adding timeout-based locking
    Adding condition variable support
    Implementing poisoning for exception safety
