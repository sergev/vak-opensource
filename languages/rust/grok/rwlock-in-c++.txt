A. Please show a meaningful C++ implementation of type RwLock<T>.

I'll create a C++ implementation of RwLock<T> similar to Rust's RwLock, which provides a reader-writer lock allowing multiple readers or one writer. We'll use C++'s std::shared_mutex (available since C++17) as the underlying synchronization primitive.

Here's the implementation:

    rwlock.cpp

Key components and features:

1. RwLock<T> Class:

    Uses std::shared_mutex for reader-writer locking
    Stores the data of type T
    Marked as mutable to allow read locking in const methods

2. ReadGuard Class:

    Uses std::shared_lock for shared access
    Provides read-only access to the data
    Multiple ReadGuards can exist simultaneously

3. WriteGuard Class:

    Uses std::unique_lock for exclusive access
    Provides read-write access to the data
    Only one WriteGuard can exist at a time

4. Interface:

    read_lock(): Returns a ReadGuard for reading
    write_lock(): Returns a WriteGuard for writing
    Both guards automatically unlock when they go out of scope (RAII)

5. Differences from Rust's RwLock:

    C++ doesn't have Rust's poisoning mechanism
    No Result/Option return types (Rust uses these for lock acquisition)
    Relies on C++ RAII instead of Rust's ownership system

The example demonstrates:

    Multiple readers can access the data simultaneously
    Writers get exclusive access
    Automatic cleanup when guards go out of scope
    Thread-safe concurrent access

Possible extensions could include:

    Try-lock variants (try_read_lock, try_write_lock)
    Timeout-based locking
    Upgradeable read locks
    Condition variable support
